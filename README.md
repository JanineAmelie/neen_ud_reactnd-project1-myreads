### Project-Overview

I created a React application from scratch and utilize React components to manage the user interface. I created a virtual bookcase to store books and track what you're reading. Using the provided Books API, I can search for books and add them to a bookshelf as a React component. I leveraged React's setState and lifeCycle to build the functionality to move books from one shelf to another.
